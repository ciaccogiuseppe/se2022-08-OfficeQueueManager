# TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team 08)

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done
- Total points committed vs. done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:

- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

### Detailed statistics

| Story | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| ----- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_  | 7       |        | 8          | 13,25        |
| _#1_  | 7       | 1      | 7,667      | 6,75         |
| _#2_  | 7       | 2      | 7,167      | 7,333        |
| _#3_  | 6       | 2      | 7,167      | 5,583        |
| _#4_  | 6       | 5      | 17,5       | 17,333       |

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|                        | estimate | actual |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| Hours per task average | 1,394    | 1,523  |
| Standard deviation     | 1,200    | 1,330  |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1 = _-0,085_

## QUALITY MEASURES

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 6
  - Total hours spent: 6,334
  - Nr of automated unit test cases: 34
  - Coverage (if available): 100%
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated: 4,5
  - Total hours spent: 5,834
- Code review
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
    > _In our case the code review is included within both test parts, so it cannot be estimated/traced_

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?\
  The main mistake was not defining and deciding exactly what each task included, especially for the front-end part.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?\


- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?\
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?\

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)\

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!\
